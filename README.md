# Test-Yolo-On-Image

The "yolov4-tiny-plateNumber.weights" file is trained for detecting the objects at a lower 
level angle (e.g., parking entrance) while it works well in other situations.

The "yolov4-tiny-obj.cfg" file contains a custom config for a single class object detection model.

The "coco.names" file contains a tag that the model is trained for (in this case only one object, plateNumber).
